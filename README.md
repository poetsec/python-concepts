This repository contains Python files demonstrating basic Python concepts.

## Notes
Notes on basic Python concepts taken during Al Sweigart's course: Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Programming.

### Booleans
- Boolean data types are true or false. 
- Comparison operators are ==, !=, <, >, <=, and >=.
- == is comparison, = is assignment.
- Boolean operators: and, or, not.

### If, Else, and Elif Statements
- An if statement can be used to conditionally execute code, depending on whether or not the if statement's condition is True or False.
- An elif (as in, "else if") statement can follow an if statement. Its block executes if its condition is true and all of the previous conditions have been false.
- The values0, 0.0, and an empty string are considered to be "falsey" values. They are considered false when used in conditions. 

### While Loops
- When the execution reaches the end of a while statement's block, it jumps back to the start to re-check the condition. 
- You can press ctrl + C to get out of an infinite loop.
- A break statement causes the program execution to immediately leave the loop without re-checking the condition.
- A continue statement causes the executuion to immediately jump back to the start of the loop and re-check the condition.

### For Loops
- For loops will loop a specific number of times.
- The range() function with a certain number will loop that number of times. 
- With a range() function with two arguments, you can set a starting integer and an ending integer.
- The range() function called with three arguments includes a starting integer, an ending integer, and a step argument which is how much the for loops's variable increases each time.
